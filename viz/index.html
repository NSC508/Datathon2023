  <h1>Crime in Seattle</h1>
  <div class="text">
    <p>
      Seattle, located in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, is a bustling city with
      a diverse population and a reputation for being one of the most liveable cities in the
      country. However, like any major metropolitan area, Seattle is not immune to crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the overall crime rate in Seattle has decreased in recent years, the city still
      experiences a significant number of crimes each year, including property crimes, violent
      crimes, and hate crimes. Understanding the nature and extent of crime in Seattle is important
      for residents, visitors, and law enforcement officials alike, as they work to create a safe
      and secure community for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this Hackathon, our team intends to predict where the next crimes are to take place using
      machine learning.

    <h3>Seattle crime has been on a steady climb since 2008</h3>

      Crime in downtown Seattle has a significant impact on the public, including residents,
      workers, and visitors to the area. The high rate of property crimes, such as theft and
      burglary, can make people feel unsafe and lead to a loss of trust in the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, the increase in violent crimes, such as assault and homicide, can cause fear and
      anxiety, especially for those who frequent downtown areas at night. Businesses in the area may
      also be affected, as customers may be hesitant to visit and spend money in areas where they
      feel unsafe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city of Seattle has implemented various measures to address the issue, including increased
      police presence and community outreach programs, but there is still much work to be done to
      ensure the safety and security of the downtown area.
    </p>
    <h3>Theft/Larceny Dominates All Crimes</h3>

      While crime in downtown Seattle may receive more attention due to its higher concentration of
      businesses and visitors, it is important to note that all neighborhoods in the city are
      experiencing similar problems with crime. Property crimes such as car theft and break-ins, as
      well as violent crimes like domestic violence and robbery, are prevalent in many Seattle
      neighborhoods. These crimes can have a significant impact on the well-being of residents and
      lead to a loss of trust in the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing crime in all neighborhoods is a critical issue for the city, and requires a
      collaborative effort from law enforcement, community organizations, and residents alike.

    <h2>Modeling Approach</h2>

      Using machine learning we did some magic...

      Consider the start date vs report date
    </p>
    <p>
      After dropping the values before 2008, we looked at the difference between the start time and
      the report time of different crimes. Here are the overall statistics:

      count 1000192
      mean -7 days +01:00:14.019099334
      std 74 days 08:32:17.741724305
      min -738 days +05:34:13
      25% -21 days +10:08:00
      50% -13 days +11:04:38.500000
      75% -5 days +09:38:36
      max 5367 days 08:23:43
      Name: time_diff, dtype: object


      If we look at only data that has a difference of fewer than 30 days, we get the following:

      count 975916
      mean -13 days +09:19:58.894871076
      std 9 days 21:07:06.260867877
      min -30 days +01:00:00
      25% -21 days +07:55:00
      50% -13 days +06:42:00
      75% -5 days +02:32:50.750000
      max 29 days 12:59:00
      Name: time_diff, dtype: object
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the Fast Fourier Transform to analyze the difference in frequencies across
      days/months/years, we get the following

      There seem to be no clear spikes in the data, meaning we donâ€™t have any dominant frequencies.
      This indicates no seasonality in the data.
